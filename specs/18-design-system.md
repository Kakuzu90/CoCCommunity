# 18 — UI/UX & Design System

## 1. Direction

A **game companion**, not a dashboard. The feel should be: bold, chunky, tactile, rewarding.
Surfaces that celebrate a player (cards, badges, stats, profiles) lean into the game vibe.
Surfaces where people work (forms, tables, admin, moderation) stay clean, dense and boring —
on purpose.

**Our visual identity is original; game content is identified with game assets.** The platform's
branding, navigation, UI components, badges, illustrations and overall look are drawn from the
genre's *conventions* (chunky buttons, resource counters, rarity tiers) and are ours. Clash of
Clans assets are used only where they identify Clash of Clans content — a troop, a hero, a spell,
a piece of equipment, a Town Hall, a clan badge, a league emblem. The full rule is §2.

## 2. Asset usage policy

Two categories of asset, two different rules. Getting this wrong is a legal risk (R2/A19 in
[24](24-risks-and-assumptions.md)), so it is stated once, here, and enforced in review.

### 2.1 Clash of Clans assets — permitted, narrowly

Supercell's Fan Content Policy permits the use of Clash of Clans assets to display or identify
Clash of Clans content. On this platform that means:

| Asset | Permitted use | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| Troop, hero, spell and hero-equipment icons | Identifying that unit in a progression grid, a level chip or a base requirement | Account detail, PlayerCard, base metadata |
| Town Hall imagery | Identifying a TH level alongside the numeral | TH badge, base card, filters |
| Clan badges | Identifying a specific clan | ClanChip, clan cards, recruitment cards |
| League emblems | Identifying a player's or clan's league | PlayerCard, stat blocks, recruitment filters |
| Hero equipment / building imagery | Identifying the item being referred to | Progression grids |

**Conditions, all of which are requirements, not guidance:**

1. **Identification only.** A game asset may only appear where it labels the specific game entity
   it depicts. It is never decoration, never a background, never a mascot, never part of a layout
   that would work identically with a shape.
2. **Unmodified.** Assets are used as supplied — no recolouring, cropping, compositing, filters,
   outlines, distortion, animation or derivative artwork, unless Supercell expressly permits it.
   Proportional scaling and standard lossless format conversion for delivery are not modifications.
3. **Never in our identity.** Not in the logo, favicon, app icon, navigation chrome, marketing
   pages, social cards, email templates, loading states, empty-state illustrations, achievement
   badges or any component that represents *Clash Commons* rather than *Clash of Clans*.
4. **Never implying endorsement.** No Supercell logo or wordmark in our branding or domain, and no
   arrangement that suggests an official relationship.
5. **Never monetised.** A game asset may not appear in a paid placement, a marketplace listing's
   own branding, or any surface where the platform charges for the asset's presence.
6. **Attribution and disclaimer.** A visible footer disclaimer on every page: *"This material is
   unofficial and is not endorsed by Supercell. For more information see Supercell's Fan Content
   Policy."* — the wording Supercell's policy asks for, linked to that policy.
7. **Revocable.** Fan content permission can be withdrawn. Every game asset is referenced through
   one resolver (§2.3), so removing or replacing the whole category is a single change.

### 2.2 Our assets — always original

Logo, wordmark, favicon, colour system, typography choices, UI components, our own icon set,
verified/featured/role badges, rarity treatments, empty-state illustrations, achievement art,
marketing imagery and the overall visual identity are created for this platform. No Supercell
font, no Supercell colour lift, no redraw or "inspired-by" trace of Supercell art, no UI sprite
reuse.

Where a genre convention overlaps with an original asset — a chunky gold button, a tiered badge —
the convention is the influence and the execution is ours ([18 §3](18-design-system.md) tokens).

### 2.3 How game assets are handled technically

- **One resolver.** `GameAssetResolver` returns a URL + accessible name for a unit, TH level, clan
  badge or league emblem. No template ever hardcodes a game-asset path. Turning the category off,
  swapping to originals, or changing the delivery origin is then one class.
- **Two sources, invisible to callers.**
  - *Curated catalogue* (troop, hero, spell and equipment icons, Town Hall imagery, league emblems):
    a finite, versioned set that staff download and upload to R2 under `game/{version}/`,
    **byte-for-byte**, served from our CDN. Procedure and rules in
    [10 §11](10-media-storage.md).
  - *Clan badges*: referenced from the API's own `badgeUrls` and stored as URLs
    (`clans.badge_urls` in [07](07-database-schema.md)). One badge per clan, unbounded and mutable
    — mirroring thousands of them would be a sync problem with no upside.
- **Never through the media pipeline.** Game assets have no `media` row, no quota, no sweeper, no
  variants. The re-encode in [10 §4](10-media-storage.md) would be a modification, so the pipeline
  is the wrong tool by definition.
- **Never transformed in delivery either.** CDN image resizing/optimisation is off for the `game/`
  prefix. Assets are sized with CSS, not by transforming the file.
- **Versioned and immutable.** `game/{version}/` is never edited in place; a corrected asset means
  a new pack version, activated by one config value and revertible the same way.
- **Provenance.** A committed `manifest.json` records slug, display name, category, source, byte
  size and SHA-256 per asset, and a weekly job verifies the bucket still matches it — so
  "unmodified" is demonstrable, not asserted.
- **Fallback always exists.** Unknown units and missing assets render our own placeholder plus the
  label; nothing depends on an asset being present ([09 §8](09-coc-api-integration.md)).
- **Kill switch.** `config('assets.enabled') = false` makes the resolver return placeholders
  everywhere. That is condition 7 of §2.1 in executable form.
- **Accessibility.** Every game asset carries an accessible name (the unit, TH level, clan or
  league name) and never carries meaning alone — the numeral or label is always present.

### 2.4 User uploads

In-game screenshots and replay videos uploaded by users are **user content**, not platform design
assets. They are fan content under the same policy, they are subject to the media pipeline and
moderation like any other upload, and they are never reused as site chrome, marketing imagery or
component artwork.

## 3. Design tokens

Delivered as CSS custom properties on `:root`, consumed by Tailwind through `@theme`.
Dark is the default and the only theme at launch; light is a Phase 7 option, which is why every
colour is referenced through a semantic token, never a raw hex, anywhere in a component.

### Colour — raw palette

```css
--clr-navy-950: #0A0D18;  /* deepest, page edges, modals scrim */
--clr-navy-900: #0E1220;  /* background */
--clr-navy-800: #161B2E;  /* surface */
--clr-navy-700: #1E2540;  /* surface raised */
--clr-navy-600: #2A3150;  /* border */
--clr-navy-500: #3A4468;  /* border strong / disabled text */

--clr-gold-400: #FFD24D;  /* primary hover / highlight */
--clr-gold-500: #F5B800;  /* primary */
--clr-gold-600: #C99400;  /* primary press / bottom border */
--clr-gold-700: #8A6600;  /* primary deep */

--clr-purple-400: #C77BFF;
--clr-purple-500: #B04CFF; /* accent */
--clr-purple-600: #8A2FD4;

--clr-green-400: #6BE8A3;
--clr-green-500: #3DDC84;  /* success */
--clr-green-600: #2AA862;

--clr-red-400:   #FF7A7A;
--clr-red-500:   #FF4D4D;  /* danger */
--clr-red-600:   #CC3333;

--clr-blue-500:  #4DA6FF;  /* info */
--clr-orange-500:#FF8A3D;  /* warning */

--clr-text:      #F2F4FA;
--clr-text-dim:  #B8C0D9;
--clr-text-muted:#8A93B2;
--clr-text-on-gold: #1A1400;  /* AA on gold-500 */
```

### Colour — semantic tokens

```css
--bg-page, --bg-surface, --bg-surface-raised, --bg-surface-hover, --bg-scrim
--border-subtle, --border-default, --border-strong, --border-focus
--text-primary, --text-secondary, --text-muted, --text-inverse
--brand-primary, --brand-primary-hover, --brand-primary-press, --brand-primary-shadow
--accent, --accent-hover
--state-success, --state-danger, --state-warning, --state-info
--badge-verified, --badge-featured
```

**Contrast commitments (WCAG AA verified, not assumed):**
- `--text-primary` on `--bg-page` ≈ 15.8:1
- `--text-muted` on `--bg-surface` ≥ 4.5:1 — muted text is never used below 14px
- `--text-on-gold` on `--brand-primary` ≥ 8:1
- Focus ring vs adjacent surface ≥ 3:1
- Every status colour is paired with a text label or icon; colour never carries meaning alone.

### Typography

```css
--font-display: 'Lilita One', 'Arial Black', system-ui, sans-serif;  /* headings, badges, stats */
--font-body:    'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
--font-mono:    'JetBrains Mono', ui-monospace, monospace;           /* player tags */
```

Self-hosted, `font-display: swap`, subset to latin + latin-ext, preloaded (display woff2 only).

| Token | Size / line-height | Weight | Font | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--text-display` | 40/44 (mobile 32/36) | 400 | display | Page hero titles |
| `--text-h1` | 32/38 (28/34) | 400 | display | Section titles |
| `--text-h2` | 24/30 | 400 | display | Card group headers |
| `--text-h3` | 20/26 | 600 | body | Card titles |
| `--text-stat` | 28/30 | 400 | display | Big numbers, tabular-nums |
| `--text-body` | 16/24 | 400 | body | Default |
| `--text-sm` | 14/20 | 400 | body | Secondary |
| `--text-xs` | 12/16 | 600 | body | Labels, pills, uppercase +0.04em |
| `--text-tag` | 14/18 | 500 | mono | Player tags |

Display font is never used below 16px (it loses legibility) and never for paragraphs.

### Spacing, radius, elevation, motion

```css
--space-1..12: 4 8 12 16 20 24 32 40 48 64 80 96 (px)

--radius-sm: 8px;    /* inputs, pills */
--radius-md: 10px;   /* buttons */
--radius-lg: 12px;   /* cards */
--radius-xl: 16px;   /* modals, feature cards */
--radius-full: 999px;

/* Depth is a solid bottom border that compresses on press — not a soft shadow. */
--depth-btn: 4px;       --depth-btn-press: 1px;
--depth-card: 3px;      --depth-card-hover: 5px;
--shadow-modal: 0 24px 48px -12px rgba(0,0,0,.7);
--shadow-glow-gold: 0 0 24px -4px rgba(245,184,0,.45);   /* highlights only, never text */

--ease-pop:   cubic-bezier(.34,1.56,.64,1);   /* overshoot, for rewards */
--ease-out:   cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1);
--dur-fast: 120ms; --dur-base: 200ms; --dur-slow: 400ms;

--z-base:0 --z-dropdown:100 --z-sticky:200 --z-modal:300 --z-toast:400
```

### Town Hall badge ramp

A distinct colour per TH range, always accompanied by the number — colour is decoration, the
numeral is the information. The badge frame, ring and tier colour are **ours**; the optional Town
Hall image inside it is a game asset used unmodified to identify that TH level (§2.1). The badge
must remain legible and correct with the game asset absent, because it renders without one wherever
the asset is unavailable or the category is switched off.

| TH range | Token | Colour | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | `--th-tier-1` | `#8A93B2` slate | Beginner |
| 5–7 | `--th-tier-2` | `#6BA84F` green | Early |
| 8–10 | `--th-tier-3` | `#4DA6FF` blue | Mid |
| 11–12 | `--th-tier-4` | `#B04CFF` purple | Late |
| 13–14 | `--th-tier-5` | `#FF8A3D` orange | Advanced |
| 15–16 | `--th-tier-6` | `#F5B800` gold | Endgame |
| 17+ | `--th-tier-7` | `#FF4D4D` + gold ring | Current max |

Implemented as one component reading a tier map, so a new TH level is a config line.

## 4. Component inventory

### Primitives

| Component | Variants | States |
|---|---|---|
| **Button** | primary (gold), secondary (surface+border), ghost, danger, success | default, hover, active(compressed), focus-visible, disabled, loading(spinner, width-locked) |

### Signature components (the ones that carry the product's identity)

**PlayerCard** — a CoC account rendered like a collectible card.
Variants: `hero` (profile header, full art treatment), `standard` (grid), `compact` (list row),
`mini` (inline attribution on a base card).
Anatomy: TH badge (corner, tier-coloured), avatar/IGN, player tag in mono, league emblem,
trophy/war-star/XP stat blocks, clan chip with role, verified badge, featured star, last-synced
timestamp.
States: verified · unverified (desaturated, "unverified" label) · disputed ("under review" ribbon) ·
stale (dimmed with "data from 3 days ago") · loading skeleton.

**BaseCard** — screenshot-led.
Anatomy: 16:9 screenshot with a subtle top-to-bottom scrim, TH badge (top-left), category pill
(top-right), video-present icon, title (2-line clamp), creator mini-card, resource-counter row
(likes/copies/views), bookmark toggle (top-right on hover/always on touch).
States: default · hover (lift 2px, border brightens) · processing (skeleton + "processing video") ·
hidden-by-moderation (staff only, red border) · no-image fallback (generated gradient + TH numeral).

**ThBadge** — hexagon-ish chunky badge (original shape), tier colour, numeral always visible,
sizes sm/md/lg. Optional unmodified Town Hall image slot resolved through `GameAssetResolver`;
falls back to numeral-only.

**StatBlock** — large `--text-stat` number with `tabular-nums`, icon above or left, label below,
optional delta chip (`+142` green / `-30` red) comparing to the previous snapshot.
Counts up on first view (respecting reduced-motion).

**ResourceCounter** — small icon + number pill used for likes, copies, views, comments. Uses
**our** icon set: these count platform actions, not game entities, so no game asset belongs here.
Interactive variant (like, bookmark) pops on activation.

**ClanChip** — clan badge (the clan's own badge image from the API, unmodified, in our frame),
clan name, role label, level. Falls back to a generated initial tile when no badge is available.

**RecruitmentCard** — clan badge or player avatar, title, requirement pills (TH, trophies,
language, war frequency), status indicator dot + label, bumped-at, primary action.

**VerifiedBadge** — gold check in a chunky circle, with a tooltip explaining what verification
means. Never rendered without an accessible label.

**RewardToast** — gold-bordered toast with an overshoot entrance and a subtle glow, used **only**
for genuine achievements: first verification, first base published, milestone reached, badge
earned. Overusing it destroys it; it is limited to a defined event list.

### Admin components (intentionally plain)
DataTable (sortable, filterable, bulk-select, sticky header), FilterBar, DetailPanel,
ActionPanel (with mandatory reason field), AuditTrailList, DiffViewer (before/after JSON),
EvidenceGallery, AssignmentControl, PriorityBadge, SlaIndicator.
These use body font, `--radius-sm`, no lift, no glow, denser spacing (`--space-2` rhythm).

**Implemented (Admin v1):** the plainness is the *layout* (`.adm-*` classes: sticky sidebar, dense
tables, small radius, no lift/glow), not a parallel control library. Form controls reuse the shared
`x-ui.*` primitives (`x-ui.select`, `x-ui.input`, `x-ui.textarea`) so inputs read the same site-wide
and there is one keyboard/focus/validation implementation to maintain. The FilterBar, DataTable,
DetailPanel, ActionPanel and AuditTrailList/DiffViewer are built; PriorityBadge, SlaIndicator,
EvidenceGallery and AssignmentControl arrive with the Phase 3 moderation queue. The admin nav uses
platform icons only (`dashboard`, `flag`, `scale`, `document`, `image`, `store`, `list` were added to
the sprite for it).

## 5. Layout

### Mobile (< 768px) — the primary target
- Sticky top bar: logo, search icon, notification bell.
- **Bottom tab navigation** (5 items, 56px + safe-area inset): Home · Bases · Recruit · Market ·
  Profile. Market is hidden until Phase 6; the slot is Search until then.
- Single-column content, 16px gutters.
- Filters open as a bottom sheet, not an inline panel.
- Primary actions are reachable with a thumb; destructive actions never are.
- Minimum touch target 44×44.

### Tablet (768–1023px)
Two-column base grid, bottom nav becomes a top nav, filters become a collapsible inline panel.

### Desktop (≥1024px)
- Left sidebar (240px, collapsible to 64px icons): primary nav + quick filters.
- Top bar: global search (prominent, `/` keyboard shortcut), notifications, user menu.
- Content max-width **1200px**, centred; base grid 3 columns (4 at ≥1440px).
- Filters as a sticky left panel inside the content column on listing pages.

### Grid
12 columns, 24px gutters at desktop, 16px at mobile. Section rhythm `--space-8`.

## 6. Page layouts

Each page below specifies its structure and its three required states
(**empty**, **loading/skeleton**, **error**).

### Home feed (`/`)
Hero strip (logged-out: value proposition + register CTA; logged-in: featured player card + quick
actions) → TH filter chip row (sticky on scroll) → sort tabs (Trending / New / Most Copied) →
base card grid → load-more.
*Empty:* "No bases match these filters" + reset-filters action + a "browse all TH levels" link.
*Loading:* 6–9 base-card skeletons in grid; chip row renders immediately.
*Error:* inline error card with retry; the chrome and navigation stay usable.

### Base detail (`/bases/{slug}`)
Breadcrumb → title + TH badge + category pill → media viewer (screenshot gallery with swipe,
video tab with poster) → **primary action: "Copy base link"** (large, gold, sticky at the bottom on
mobile) → stat row → description → tags → creator card → share row → report link → comments →
related bases.
*Empty (no comments):* "Be the first to comment" + input focus.
*Loading:* media placeholder at the correct aspect ratio (no layout shift), skeleton text lines.
*Error (base processing):* "This base is still processing" with an auto-refresh poll.
*Error (not found/removed):* dedicated page explaining removal vs non-existence, without leaking
which.

### Player profile (`/u/{username}`)
Cover band with avatar, display name, username, verified badge, member-since, country flag,
follow button (P2) → featured PlayerCard (hero variant) → stat blocks (bases, likes received,
copies, war stars across accounts) → tabs: Accounts · Bases · Activity (P2) · Bookmarks (own only)
→ tab content.
*Empty (no accounts):* prompt to attach an account (own profile) / "no public accounts" (others).
*Empty (no bases):* own → "publish your first base" CTA; others → muted message.
*Loading:* cover + avatar skeleton, then tab content skeletons.
*Error (private profile):* "This profile is private" card, nothing else disclosed.

### CoC account detail (`/accounts/{ulid}`)
PlayerCard hero → verification status banner → stat blocks with deltas → hero/troop/spell/equipment
progression grids (level chips, maxed indicator) → custom images gallery → bases credited to this
account → sync status footer ("updated 12 minutes ago" + manual refresh button).
*Empty (no images):* owner sees an upload dropzone; others see nothing.
*Loading:* progression grid skeleton.
*Error (API stale):* amber banner "Game data is temporarily unavailable — showing data from
{time}", content still fully rendered.

### Attach account flow (`/accounts/attach`)
Three steps with a progress indicator: (1) enter tag → confirmation card; (2) in-game token
instructions with an illustrated, original step-by-step and a paste field; (3) success screen with
a RewardToast and a "set as featured" prompt.
*Error states:* tag not found · already verified by someone else (conflict card with both the token
path and the dispute path) · invalid token (with "tokens expire in a few minutes — copy a fresh
one") · API unavailable (retry later, nothing lost).

### Base composer (`/bases/create`)
Step-less single form: media dropzone first (upload begins immediately, progress per file) →
title/description → TH + category selectors (large tactile tiles, not a dropdown) → base link with
live validation and a parsed preview → tags with suggestions → visibility → publish.
*Loading:* per-file upload progress; publish button disabled with a reason ("2 files still
uploading").
*Error:* per-field inline errors, per-file upload errors with retry, and a draft preserved in
`localStorage` so nothing is lost.

### Recruitment listing (`/recruit`) — P2
Toggle: Find a Clan / Find Players → filter bar (bottom sheet on mobile) → recruitment cards →
pagination.
*Empty:* "No posts match" + widen-filters suggestion + "create a post" CTA.
*Loading:* card skeletons.
*Error:* retry card.

### Marketplace listing (`/market`) — P3
Category chip row → listing grid with seller cards → filters.
Always shows a persistent, dismissible **"we do not handle payments"** banner on the index and an
interstitial before a first order.

### Notifications (`/notifications`)
Chronological rows, with unread entries on a raised navy surface and an explicit gold “Unread” label,
category filters, pagination, and mark-all-read. Grouped social entries arrive with Notifications v2.
*Empty:* "You're all caught up" with the existing bell icon. The bell includes loading, offline,
database-error/retry and empty states; its popup closes with Escape or an outside click.
Signed-in compact headers retain the brand mark and accessible full name below 1024px. Tablet
navigation already includes Search, so the duplicate search icon is omitted to keep the bell and
account control within the viewport.

### Settings (`/settings/*`)
Sub-nav (Profile · Privacy · Accounts · Security · Notifications · Danger zone) with plain, dense
forms. Danger zone is visually separated with a red border and requires password confirmation.

*Phase 1 implementation:* the sub-nav is a horizontal tab row under the page heading rather than a
left rail, because the settings pages are a single narrow column and a rail would cost width the
forms need. The active tab carries `aria-current="page"` and a brand underline. `View profile` and
`Delete account` sit in a divided group at the end: one leaves settings, the other is the danger
zone, and neither is a peer of the tabs. Accounts and Notifications arrive with their phase tasks.

### Admin (`/admin/*`)
Left nav (Dashboard · Reports · Disputes · Users · Content · Media · Marketplace · Logs) →
DataTable views → detail/action panels. No game styling, no animation beyond 120ms fades,
information-dense, keyboard-first.
*Empty:* "No open cases" — a genuinely good state, presented as such.
*Loading:* table row skeletons that preserve column widths.
*Error:* inline error with the request id, for support correlation.

## 7. Motion

| Interaction | Motion | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Button press | `translateY(3px)`, bottom border 4px→1px | 80ms |
| Card hover | `translateY(-2px)`, border brightens, depth 3→5px | 200ms `--ease-out` |
| Like / bookmark | Icon scale 1→1.35→1 with `--ease-pop`, counter increments | 400ms |
| Stat count-up | 0 → value, eased, once per page view, only for values > 0 | 800ms |
| Reward toast | Slide + slight overshoot + gold glow fade | 500ms |
| Modal / sheet | Fade scrim 150ms; sheet slides up 250ms `--ease-out` | — |
| Skeleton shimmer | 1.5s linear loop | — |
| Page transition | None. Server-rendered navigation stays instant and honest | — |

`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — all transforms and loops are disabled, transitions drop
to ≤50ms opacity only, count-ups render the final value immediately, and shimmer becomes a static
tint. This is implemented once in the base stylesheet, not per component.

## 8. Accessibility checklist (enforced in review)

- Contrast AA for all text and meaningful non-text (verified against the token pairs above).
- Colour is never the only carrier of meaning — TH badges show numerals, statuses show labels,
  charts show patterns.
- Every interactive element is reachable by keyboard with a visible 2px `--border-focus` ring and a
  2px offset.
- Modals and sheets trap focus, restore it on close, and close on `Esc`.
- Skip-to-content link as the first focusable element.
- Landmarks: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`; one `h1` per page and no skipped heading levels.
- All images have alt text; decorative images use `alt=""`; user-uploaded screenshots default to
  the base title.
- Icon-only buttons carry `aria-label`.
- Live regions: toasts `role="status"`, errors `role="alert"`, the notification count
  `aria-live="polite"`.
- Forms: every input has a `<label>`, errors are linked via `aria-describedby`, and the first error
  receives focus on failed submit.
- Touch targets ≥44×44 with ≥8px separation.
- Tested with keyboard only and with VoiceOver/NVDA on the five main flows before each phase ships.

## 9. Implementation notes

- Tailwind CSS 4 with `@theme` mapping the semantic tokens; **arbitrary colour values are banned**
  in templates — a lint rule enforces token usage.
- Blade components under `resources/views/components/{ui,game,admin}/`, with a living component
  gallery at `/dev/components` (non-production only) showing every variant and state. This page is
  the design system's actual source of truth and must be updated with each new variant.
- Alpine for local interactivity (menus, sheets, tabs, optimistic like animation); Livewire only
  where server state is involved.
- Icons: one original 24px outline set, delivered as an inline SVG sprite; no icon font, no
  third-party set that ships brand marks. Platform iconography never mixes with game assets inside
  the same sprite.
- Game assets (units, Town Halls, clan badges, league emblems) are rendered **only** through
  `<x-game.asset>` / `GameAssetResolver` (§2.3), unmodified, always with an accessible name, and
  always with a non-asset fallback. A review-checklist item and a lint rule ban game-asset paths in
  templates.
- Illustrations for empty states: original, simple geometric shapes in brand colours — no
  characters, no redraws of game art.
- Images: `loading="lazy"` below the fold, explicit `width`/`height`, `srcset` from media variants,
  `fetchpriority="high"` on the base-detail hero image only.
- Dark-mode-only at launch; every colour already routes through a semantic token, so adding light
  is a token-file addition, not a component rewrite.
- The fan-content disclaimer (§2.1 condition 6) is part of the global footer component, present on
  every page including admin, and is not dismissible.

### Phase 0 implementation

Tokens live in `src/resources/css/tokens.css`, mapped through Tailwind 4 `@theme inline`.
`ui.css` contains reusable component styles and the shared reduced-motion rule. The gallery has
its own small presentation wrapper. The application shell (`<x-layouts.app>`, top bar, desktop
sidebar, mobile bottom tabs, footer disclaimer) ships in the app-shell task and drives its
primary nav from `config/navigation.php`.

The primitive API and integration examples are documented in
[`components/ui/README.md`](../src/resources/views/components/ui/README.md). The gallery demonstrates
buttons, fields, searchable selects, choice controls, cards, pills, badges, avatars,
modal/sheet, toasts, alerts, skeletons, empty state, tooltips, menus, tabs, pagination, load-more /
sentinel and progress. GameAsset and the signature/domain-specific components stay in their
respective phase tasks. Category/TH pills are labelled generic primitives until those domain maps exist.

Implementation choices:
- Native `<dialog>` provides background inertness, with an explicit keyboard focus cycle, Escape,
  focus restoration, scroll lock, and a mobile bottom-sheet treatment.
- Selects use a Select2-style Alpine dropdown with inline search, selected-option indicators,
  optional-value clearing, keyboard navigation, focus restoration, and no-match feedback.
  The backing native select supports form submission, Livewire events, and a no-JavaScript fallback.
- Fonts are locked Fontsource dependencies (Lilita One, Inter, JetBrains Mono), served locally by
  Vite with latin/latin-ext subsets and `font-display: swap`. Only the display WOFF2 is preloaded.
- Livewire's ESM bundle supplies the single Alpine instance; local UI actions perform no server writes.
- Small button sizes remain 32/40/48px on fine pointers, with at least 44px on coarse pointers.
- The gallery is guarded at request time and returns 404 in production, including with cached routes.
- Raw template colors are checked in `DesignTokensTest` across `components/`, `dev/` and `pages/`.
  The stock Laravel welcome view was removed when the app shell replaced the home route.

Verification: PHP tests cover gallery access, markup contracts and escaping; Playwright + axe cover
WCAG 2.1 A/AA automated checks, dialog focus, menu/tab keyboards, field feedback, avatar fallback,
360px layout, and reduced motion. Browser CI runs alongside the SQLite/Postgres test matrix.
Automated checks supplement the manual assistive-technology review of product flows at phase exit.
