# Clash Commons — Specification Set

Planning documents for the Clash of Clans community platform described in [project.md](project.md).
No implementation code lives here. Each file is self-contained enough to be converted into
development tasks for an agentic coding workflow.

## Load map

The numbering above is a reading order for a person. **Do not load the set in order for a coding
task** — load by what you are building.

### Always in context

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| [README.md](README.md) | Locked decisions |
| [05-architecture.md](05-architecture.md) | Module boundaries, event seam, where code goes |
| [19-module-structure.md](19-module-structure.md) | Folder layout, naming, dependency rules |
| [04-roles-and-permissions.md](04-roles-and-permissions.md) | Every write surface needs a policy |

### Per task

| Building | Load |
|---|---|
| Any migration / model | [07](07-database-schema.md), [08](08-entity-relationships.md) |
| Auth, registration, sessions | [04](04-roles-and-permissions.md), [11](11-security.md) |
| CoC attach / verify / dispute | [13](13-claiming-workflow.md), [09](09-coc-api-integration.md), [07](07-database-schema.md) |
| Account sync, API client | [09](09-coc-api-integration.md), [20](20-jobs-and-scheduling.md) |
| Bases, feed, comments | [02](02-functional-requirements.md) (FR-BASE), [07](07-database-schema.md), [17](17-search-and-discovery.md) |
| Uploads, images, video | [10](10-media-storage.md), [20](20-jobs-and-scheduling.md) |
| Game assets | [18 §2](18-design-system.md), [10 §11](10-media-storage.md) |
| Any UI | [18](18-design-system.md) |
| Reports, moderation, admin | [12](12-moderation-system.md), [04](04-roles-and-permissions.md) |
| Recruitment | [14](14-recruitment-workflow.md), [07](07-database-schema.md) |
| Marketplace | [15](15-marketplace-workflow.md) |
| Notifications | [16](16-notifications.md) |
| Search | [17](17-search-and-discovery.md) |
| Jobs, schedule, caching | [20](20-jobs-and-scheduling.md), [21](21-caching-strategy.md) |

### Add to every task

- [02](02-functional-requirements.md) — the `FR-*` ids the task satisfies
- [23](23-edge-cases.md) — the rows for the domain being touched
- [11](11-security.md) — if the surface takes user input, files, or crosses a trust boundary

### Per phase task

[25 §4](25-development-phases.md) maps each phase task to its exact spec bundle (core + supporting).
Start there when picking up a task; the tables above are the fallback for work that does not map to
a phase task.

### Not implementation input

[01](01-product-overview.md), [03](03-non-functional-requirements.md),
[06](06-tech-stack.md), [22](22-scaling.md), [24](24-risks-and-assumptions.md) — planning context.
Read [25](25-development-phases.md) once when starting a phase to pick and shape tasks, then drop it.

## Locked decisions

These are settled; changing one means revisiting the affected specs.

1. **Modular monolith**, Laravel 12 / PHP 8.3, one deployable. No microservices before Stage 3 traffic.
2. **Laravel + Livewire 3 + Tailwind + Alpine.** Not Inertia, not a split SPA. Rationale in [06](06-tech-stack.md).
3. **PostgreSQL 16** as the only datastore for MVP, including cache, queue and session tables.
4. **No Redis at launch.** All code goes through `Cache`/`Queue` facades. Switch triggers in [21](21-caching-strategy.md).
5. **Cloudflare R2 + CDN** for all media. Nothing binary in the database.
6. **Supercell content policy compliance is a hard constraint.** No account trading, no real-money gambling. Clash of Clans assets (troops, heroes, spells, equipment, Town Halls, clan badges, league emblems) may be used **unmodified, to identify game content only**; our branding, navigation, UI components, badges, illustrations and visual identity stay original ([18 §2](18-design-system.md)).
7. **No payment processing in the MVP marketplace.** See the risk analysis in [15](15-marketplace-workflow.md).
